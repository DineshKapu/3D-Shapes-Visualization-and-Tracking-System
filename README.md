# 3D Shapes Visualization and Tracking System
## Project Overview
A real-time interactive system that visualizes and tracks the positions of 3D shapes (cube and cone) with synchronized web display.
This project provides a real-time 3D visualization system that allows users to:
-Control a cube and cone in a 3D space using keyboard inputs
-View the positions of both shapes in a web interface
-See both shapes' movements visualized in a single graph with a shared origin point

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Interactive 3D Control**:
  - ðŸŸ¦ Cube manipulation with WASD-QE keys
  - ðŸ”º Cone control using arrow keys + TAB/SHIFT
- **Real-time Visualization**:
  - Single coordinate system with shared origin
  - Color-coded vectors (blue for cube, red for cone)
- **Web Interface**:
  - Live coordinate tracking
  - Connection status monitoring
  - Responsive design
